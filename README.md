STLCG
======

A toolbox to compute the robustness of STL formulas using computations graphs (PyTorch).

## Installation

To visualize the graphs, you will need the following packages:

Install graphviz, e.g.:

```
brew install graphviz
```

Install the package itself:

```
pip install torchviz
```

The vizualization code here is constructed from https://github.com/szagoruyko/pytorchviz but with modifications to represent STL operators.


## Usage

stlc_cg demo.ipynb is a IPython jupyter notebook that showcases the basic functionality of the toolbox.
